The implementation of the service relies on the DONA/Handle persistent identifier solution. B2HANDLE can be used by middleware applications, end-user tools and other service to reliably identify data objects over longer timespans and through changes in object location or ownership. The B2HANDLE service encompasses management of identifier namespaces (Handle prefixes), establishment of policies and business workflows, operation of Handle servers and technical services, and a user-friendly Python library for general interaction with Handle servers and EUDAT-specific extensions. B2HANDLE is mostly transparent to end-users, shielding them from the complexity of infrastructure details. B2HANDLE supports a dedicated Handle record structure (a PID profile) for the safe data management within an infrastructure with a given topology.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"pyhandle-tutorial/authenticate-with-the-library":{"id":"pyhandle-tutorial/authenticate-with-the-library","title":"Authentication","description":"For creating and modifying handles* you need to authenticate at the Handle Server you\u2019d like to write to.
