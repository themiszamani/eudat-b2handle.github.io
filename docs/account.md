# Request an account

In order to start using the service you need a Prefix and of course an account. 

The service is offered by a number of EUDAT Partners . 

If you want to just test the service some of the partners can provide you with an account under a test prefix. 
This can be used to test EUDAT B2HANDLE and your proof of concept for using handles. The handles under the test prefix are NOT permanent.

If you would like to obtain a test or a production prefix, please contact [EUDAT](https://eudat.eu/support-request?service=B2HANDLE).
